   LShift is a hi-tech software development company. It is small but, we like to think, close to perfectly formed. Our company is home to some of the best developers in the UK - not only in our opinion, but in the opinion of a number of international blue chip companies who use our development and research skills.
   The key to our business is simple. We create an environment that allows the best developers and engineers to work in a way which unlocks their creative potential, then we recruit the best minds we can find to work in that environment.
